Data Structures & Algorithms in Java

This repository documents my journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms using Java, with a strong focus on clean code, optimization, and problem-solving fundamentals.

📌 What you’ll find here:

✅ Core DSA concepts implemented in Java

✅ Optimized solutions with time & space complexity analysis

✅ Matrix problems (diagonal sum, traversal, etc.)

✅ Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees (ongoing)

✅ Interview-oriented problems with clear logic

✅ Beginner-friendly explanations in code comments

🎯 Goals of this repository:

Build strong DSA fundamentals

Improve problem-solving & logical thinking

Prepare for coding interviews

Practice writing efficient and readable Java code

🧠 Learning Approach:

Start with a brute-force solution

Optimize step-by-step

Focus on why a solution works, not just how

🚧 Status:

This repository is actively updated as I continue learning and improving.
